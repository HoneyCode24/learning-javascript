## Now I am keeping this project on hold because of some reason like:-
Over-perfection & Scope Creep
I am treating this Tic Tac Toe like a commercial product instead of a learning project. Medium/Hard AI logic, animations, UI themes — these are cool, but they’re slowing me down.
→ I am stuck in polishing instead of progressing.

Unclear Boundaries of Completion
The goal was to learn frontend foundations, but now the goal of the project is vague — "until it’s perfect."
→ Projects need clear done-is-done checkpoints, or I will always feel like you’re failing.
So, on purpose I am pausing this tic tac toe project.

“This was my first logic-based project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helped me understand DOM manipulation, game logic, and UI interaction. The medium-level AI logic was partially sourced and adapted.”

In this project (Tic Tac Toe webgame) contain a landing page, Three levels of difficulity in which only easy and medium level works
